Let B_i be the (bad) event that vertex i doesn't have degree $(1 \pm log(n)/\sqrt{np})np$. You're asked to show that

$Prob [B_1 \cup B_2 \cup ... \cup B_n ] = o(1)$. This is a stronger statement than, "For each $i$, $Prob[B_i] = o(1)$." It is the latter that follows from the symmetry you mentioned, but it is not what you need to show...
